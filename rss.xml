            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Incredible New Images Of Mars Are So High-Res, You Can See Beagle 2 On The Surface</h1><p>Long gone are the days of seeing mysterious faces in blurry images from the surface of Mars. Satellite images of the Red Planet are now getting the high-resolution treatment. Thanks to a new technique, called Super-Resolution Restoration (SRR), researchers from University College London were able to go beyond the 25-centimeter (10-inch) resolution limit of current cameras.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c8985cd303dc5bf83ec64d964c2950ed6959ef8d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Astronomers Have Discovered A New Moon In Our Solar System</h1><p>"Moon over Makemake" sounds like a novel or painting, but actually represents a NASA announcement of the discovery of a companion for the third largest (and second brightest) dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt. The announcement strengthens the hypothesis that most dwarf planets have moons, while also making Pluto look somewhat less special.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/44066b533d4e39aaf91134f8c9768b9118d6ac44.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Hypothesis Could Explain How The "Impossible" EM Drive Works</h1><p>If there's one thing guaranteed to ruffle a few feathers, it's surely the EM Drive. Billed in some corners as the holy grail of deep space travel, others (including us) have been quick to calm expectations about what is still very much a theoretical concept at the moment.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d5f41f0ba901f5ac41ac60bd6976062ecd973cd8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Evidence Suggests Mars Once Had Much More Oxygen Than It Does Now</h1><p>Speaking at the European Geophysical Union in Vienna this week, a team of scientists said they have found strong evidence for Mars once having a lot more oxygen than it does currently. The results, if confirmed, would have important implications for the potential ancient habitability of Mars.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7888ba2339e81df6a114c18d31eb353976371c63.jpg"></article>]]></description>
